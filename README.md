___________
This is a run-of-river project located in the Kullu District in the state of Himachal Pradesh. It 
utilizes flow of Allain and Dhungan Nallah of Beas River in district Kullu. The project envisages 
a generation capacity of 2.5 MW of power by utilizing the available rated net head 22 m. The 
project consists of a two Kaplan hydro turbine of 1.25 MW each. The net generated electricity 
from the project activity was sold to the state electricity board i.e., Himachal Pradesh State 
Electricity Board Ltd. (HPSEBL) under the Short Term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) till 
March 2018 and since then it has been sold to IEX through open access request from HPSEBL 
every month. The details of the project activity are verified with the project report copy 
submitted for verification.

As mentioned in the monitoring report and emission reduction calculation sheet submitted for 
verification, the project replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) 
estimated to be approximately 37746 tCO2e for this monitoring period under verification, there 
on displacing 41944 MWh amount of electricity from the generation mix of power plants 
connected to the Indian electricity grid, which is mainly dominated by the fossil-fuel based 
power plant.
